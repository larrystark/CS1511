<h3>Programming Project 7 </h3>
<p>
Consider the Bag ADT. You have already identified that it has two important
data members
The class has the following attributes:
</p><ul>
<li> n, an integer, (the number of items in the bag)
</li><li> an array of strings (the contents of the bag)
</li></ul>
<p> and the following member functions
</p><ul>
<li> add() - to add an item to the bag
</li><li> show() - to list all of the items in the bag
</li></ul>
<p> You may have also implemented a remove() function
</p><ul>
<li> remove() - to remove an item from the bag
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p> To fulfill all requirements for this program you must 
implement the following public class methods:
</p><ul>
<li> remove() - to remove an item from the bag
</li><li> isEmpty() - to see whether the bag is empty. 
</li><li> clear() - to empty the bag
</li></ul>
<p>
The main change in this implementation of the Bag ADT is that
you will also implement another class (the Item ADT). Instead of
the data implementation being an array of strings, make it an
array of Item objects.
</p><p>
This means that your public member functions of the Bag ADT will
need to be revised to handle Item objects, not just strings.
</p><p>
Use the main program provided and the Coding Challenge from this
week to complete the project.
